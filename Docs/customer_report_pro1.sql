-- =============================================================
-- Customer Report
-- =============================================================
-- Purpose:
--   This report consolidates key customer metrics and behaviors.
-- Highlights:
--   1. Gathers essential fields such as names, ages, and transaction details.
--   2. Segments customers into categories (VIP, Regular, New) and age groups.
--   3. Aggregates customer-level metrics:
--        total orders, total sales, total quantity purchased,
--        total products, lifespan (in months)
--   4. Calculates valuable KPIs:
--        recency (months since last order),
--        average order value, average monthly spend
